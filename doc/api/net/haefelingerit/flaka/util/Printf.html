</PRE>

<P>
PrintfFormat allows the formatting of an array of objects embedded within a
 string. Primitive types must be passed using wrapper types. The formatting is
 controlled by a control string.
 <p>
 A control string is a Java string that contains a control specification. The
 control specification starts at the first percent sign (%) in the string,
 provided that this percent sign
 <ol>
 <li>is not escaped protected by a matching % or is not an escape %
 character,
 <li>is not at the end of the format string, and
 <li>precedes a sequence of characters that parses as a valid control
 specification.
 </ol>
 </p>
 <p>
 A control specification usually takes the form:
 
 <pre>
  % ['-+ #0]* [0..9]* { . [0..9]* }+
                { [hlL] }+ [idfgGoxXeEcs]
 </pre>
 
 There are variants of this basic form that are discussed below.
 </p>
 <p>
 The format is composed of zero or more directives defined as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>ordinary characters, which are simply copied to the output stream;
 <li>escape sequences, which represent non-graphic characters; and
 <li>conversion specifications, each of which results in the fetching of zero
 or more arguments.
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 The results are undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format.
 Usually an unchecked exception will be thrown. If the format is exhausted
 while arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise
 ignored. In format strings containing the % form of conversion
 specifications, each argument in the argument list is used exactly once.
 </p>
 <p>
 Conversions can be applied to the <code>n</code>th argument after the
 format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In this
 case, the conversion characer % is replaced by the sequence %<code>n</code>$,
 where <code>n</code> is a decimal integer giving the position of the
 argument in the argument list.
 </p>
 <p>
 In format strings containing the %<code>n</code>$ form of conversion
 specifications, each argument in the argument list is used exactly once.
 </p>

 </p>
 <h4>Conversion Specifications</h4>
 <p>
 Each conversion specification is introduced by the percent sign character
 (%). After the character %, the following appear in sequence:
 </p>
 <p>
 Zero or more flags (in any order), which modify the meaning of the conversion
 specification.
 </p>
 <p>
 An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer characters
 than the field width, it will be padded with spaces by default on the left; t
 will be padded on the right, if the left- adjustment flag (-), described
 below, is given to the field width. The field width takes the form of a
 decimal integer. If the conversion character is s, the field width is the the
 minimum number of characters to be printed.
 </p>
 <p>
 An optional precision that gives the minumum number of digits to appear for
 the d, i, o, x or X conversions (the field is padded with leading zeros); the
 number of digits to appear after the radix character for the e, E, and f
 conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for the g and G
 conversions; or the maximum number of characters to be written from a string
 is s and S conversions. The precision takes the form of an optional decimal
 digit string, where a null digit string is treated as 0. If a precision
 appears with a c conversion character the precision is ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
 An optional h specifies that a following d, i, o, x, or X conversion
 character applies to a type short argument (the argument will be promoted
 according to the integral promotions and its value converted to type short
 before printing).
 </p>
 <p>
 An optional l (ell) specifies that a following d, i, o, x, or X conversion
 character applies to a type long argument.
 </p>
 <p>
 A field width or precision may be indicated by an asterisk (*) instead of a
 digit string. In this case, an integer argument supplised the field width
 precision. The argument that is actually converted is not fetched until the
 conversion letter is seen, so the the arguments specifying field width or
 precision must appear before the argument (if any) to be converted. If the
 precision argument is negative, it will be changed to zero. A negative field
 width argument is taken as a - flag, followed by a positive field width.
 </p>
 <p>
 In format strings containing the %<code>n</code>$ form of a conversion
 specification, a field width or precision may be indicated by the sequence *<code>m</code>$,
 where m is a decimal integer giving the position in the argument list (after
 the format argument) of an integer argument containing the field width or
 precision.
 </p>
 <p>
 The format can contain either numbered argument specifications (that is, %<code>n</code>$
 and *<code>m</code>$), or unnumbered argument specifications (that is %
 and *), but normally not both. The only exception to this is that %% can be
 mixed with the %<code>n</code>$ form. The results of mixing numbered and
 unnumbered argument specifications in a format string are undefined.
 </p>
 
 <h4>Flag Characters</h4>
 <p>
 The flags and their meanings are:
 </p>
 <dl>
 <dt>'
 <dd> integer portion of the result of a decimal conversion (%i, %d, %f, %g,
 or %G) will be formatted with thousands' grouping characters. For other
 conversions the flag is ignored. The non-monetary grouping character is used.
 <dt>-
 <dd> result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It will be
 right-justified if this flag is not specified).</td>
 </tr>
 <dt>+
 <dd> result of a signed conversion always begins with a sign (+ or -). (It
 will begin with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag
 is not specified.)
 <dt>&lt;space&gt;
 <dd> If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, a space
 character will be placed before the result. This means that if the space
 character and + flags both appear, the space flag will be ignored.
 <dt>#
 <dd> value is to be converted to an alternative form. For c, d, i, and s
 conversions, the flag has no effect. For o conversion, it increases the
 precision to force the first digit of the result to be a zero. For x or X
 conversion, a non-zero result has 0x or 0X prefixed to it, respectively. For
 e, E, f, g, and G conversions, the result always contains a radix character,
 even if no digits follow the radix character (normally, a decimal point
 appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it). For g
 and G conversions, trailing zeros will not be removed from the result as they
 normally are.
 <dt>0
 <dd> d, i, o, x, X, e, E, f, g, and G conversions, leading zeros (following
 any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width; no space
 padding is performed. If the 0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is
 ignored. For d, i, o, x, and X conversions, if a precision is specified, the
 0 flag will be ignored. For c conversions, the flag is ignored.
 </dl>
 
 <h4>Conversion Characters</h4>
 <p>
 Each conversion character results in fetching zero or more arguments. The
 results are undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format.
 Usually, an unchecked exception will be thrown. If the format is exhausted
 while arguments remain, the excess arguments are ignored.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The conversion characters and their meanings are:
 </p>
 <dl>
 <dt>d,i
 <dd>The int argument is converted to a signed decimal in the style [-]dddd.
 The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
 being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it will be expanded with
 leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting 0 with an
 explicit precision of 0 is no characters.
 <dt>o
 <dd> The int argument is converted to unsigned octal format in the style
 ddddd. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
 value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it will be expanded
 with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting 0
 with an explicit precision of 0 is no characters.
 <dt>x
 <dd> The int argument is converted to unsigned hexadecimal format in the
 style dddd; the letters abcdef are used. The precision specifies the minimum
 numberof digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in
 fewer digits, it will be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision
 is 1. The result of converting 0 with an explicit precision of 0 is no
 characters.
 <dt>X
 <dd> Behaves the same as the x conversion character except that letters
 ABCDEF are used instead of abcdef.
 <dt>f
 <dd> The floating point number argument is written in decimal notation in the
 style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after the radix character (shown
 here as a decimal point) is equal to the precision specification. A Locale is
 used to determine the radix character to use in this format. If the precision
 is omitted from the argument, six digits are written after the radix
 character; if the precision is explicitly 0 and the # flag is not specified,
 no radix character appears. If a radix character appears, at least 1 digit
 appears before it. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
 <dt>e,E
 <dd>The floating point number argument is written in the style
 [-]d.ddde{+-}dd (the symbols {+-} indicate either a plus or minus sign),
 where there is one digit before the radix character (shown here as a decimal
 point) and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision. A Locale
 is used to determine the radix character to use in this format. When the
 precision is missing, six digits are written after the radix character; if
 the precision is 0 and the # flag is not specified, no radix character
 appears. The E conversion will produce a number with E instead of e
 introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits.
 However, if the value to be written requires an exponent greater than two
 digits, additional exponent digits are written as necessary. The value is
 rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
 <dt>g,G
 <dd>The floating point number argument is written in style f or e (or in
 sytle E in the case of a G conversion character), with the precision
 specifying the number of significant digits. If the precision is zero, it is
 taken as one. The style used depends on the value converted: style e (or E)
 will be used only if the exponent resulting from the conversion is less than
 -4 or greater than or equal to the precision. Trailing zeros are removed from
 the result. A radix character appears only if it is followed by a digit.
 <dt>c,C
 <dd>The integer argument is converted to a char and the result is written.
 
 <dt>s,S
 <dd>The argument is taken to be a string and bytes from the string are
 written until the end of the string or the number of bytes indicated by the
 precision specification of the argument is reached. If the precision is
 omitted from the argument, it is taken to be infinite, so all characters up
 to the end of the string are written.
 <dt>%
 <dd>Write a % character; no argument is converted.
 </dl>
 <p>
 If a conversion specification does not match one of the above forms, an
 IllegalArgumentException is thrown and the instance of PrintfFormat is not
 created.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a floating point value is the internal representation for infinity, the
 output is [+]Infinity, where Infinity is either Infinity or Inf, depending on
 the desired output string length. Printing of the sign follows the rules
 described above.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a floating point value is the internal representation for "not-a-number,"
 the output is [+]NaN. Printing of the sign follows the rules described above.
 </p>
 <p>
 In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
 field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field
 is simply expanded to contain the conversion result.
 </p>
 <p>
 The behavior is like printf. One exception is that the minimum number of
 exponent digits is 3 instead of 2 for e and E formats when the optional L is
 used before the e, E, g, or G conversion character. The optional L does not
 imply conversion to a long long double.
 </p>
 <p>
 The biggest divergence from the C printf specification is in the use of 16
 bit characters. This allows the handling of characters beyond the small ASCII
 character set and allows the utility to interoperate correctly with the rest
 of the Java runtime environment.
 </p>
 <p>
 Omissions from the C printf specification are numerous. All the known
 omissions are present because Java never uses bytes to represent characters
 and does not have pointers:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>%c is the same as %C.
 <li>%s is the same as %S.
 <li>u, p, and n conversion characters.
 <li>%ws format.
 <li>h modifier applied to an n conversion character.
 <li>l (ell) modifier applied to the c, n, or s conversion characters.
 <li>ll (ell ell) modifier to d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion characters.
 <li>ll (ell ell) modifier to an n conversion character.
 <li>c, C, d,i,o,u,x, and X conversion characters apply to Byte, Character,
 Short, Integer, Long types.
 <li>f, e, E, g, and G conversion characters apply to Float and Double types.
 <li>s and S conversion characters apply to String types.
 <li>All other reference types can be formatted using the s or S conversion
 characters only.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Most of this specification is quoted from the Unix man page for the sprintf
 utility.
