1.02.01
* [http://code.google.com/p/flaka/issues/detail?id=4] rebuilding flaka with
Ant 1.8 to avoid PropertyHelper12.class problem. No changes in source code.
Patch counter bumped to avoid confusion.
* build.xml: updated to generate Java 1.5 compatible code
* build.xml: use package-dist to generate a release build. Ensures that 1.8
  is used. Would be better though to test that all class files are packaged. 

1.02.00
* updated to JUEL 2.2.1 (was 2.1.1-rc4)
* using ant-antunit (1.1) to run Ant based unit tests
* refactoring ant unit tests (test/test-*.xml) 
* <switch /> redesigned to have elements re, glob, cmp and matches, attributes find, not and literally
(legacy, deprecated)
* fixed bug in <switch/matches[glob]/> to avoid partial matches.
* new distributable "ant-flaka-bare-${version}.jar" introduced - does
not contain any inlined dependencies (as ant-flaka-${version}.jar) does.
* <trycatch /> extended with <else /> clause (warning: conflicting exceptions)
